# HIPAA Compliance and Medical Data Security Documentation

## üè• **Medical Data Compliance Framework**

### **1. HIPAA Compliance Overview**

Cureliah handles Protected Health Information (PHI) and must comply with HIPAA regulations.

#### **PHI Data Classification**
- **Category 1 - Direct PHI**: Patient names, contact information, medical records
- **Category 2 - Indirect PHI**: Anonymized medical data, aggregated statistics  
- **Category 3 - Business Data**: Doctor profiles, establishment info, booking metadata

#### **Compliance Requirements Implemented**
- ‚úÖ **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions (doctor, establishment, admin)
- ‚úÖ **Data Encryption**: SSL/TLS in transit, database encryption at rest
- ‚úÖ **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking
- ‚úÖ **User Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication ready
- ‚úÖ **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary medical information

### **2. Technical Security Measures**

#### **Encryption Standards**
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 minimum for all API communications
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for database storage
- **Key Management**: Separate encryption keys for different data types

#### **Access Control Matrix**

| User Type | Patient Data | Medical Records | Financial Data | System Admin |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Doctor | Read Own | Read/Write Own | Read Own | No |
| Establishment | Read Assigned | Read Assigned | Read/Write Own | No |
| Admin | Read All | Read All | Read All | Full |
| Patient | Read Own | Read Own | Read Own | No |

#### **Network Security**
- **Firewall Rules**: Strict inbound/outbound traffic control
- **VPN Access**: Required for administrative access
- **IP Allowlisting**: Restrict access to known medical facilities
- **DDoS Protection**: Rate limiting and traffic analysis

### **3. Data Handling Procedures**

#### **PHI Data Lifecycle**
1. **Collection**: Minimal necessary data with explicit consent
2. **Processing**: Encrypted processing with audit trails
3. **Storage**: Segregated storage with access controls
4. **Transmission**: Encrypted channels only
5. **Retention**: Automatic deletion per retention policies
6. **Disposal**: Secure deletion with verification

#### **Consent Management**
- **Explicit Consent**: Clear opt-in for data collection
- **Granular Controls**: Separate consent for different data uses
- **Withdrawal Rights**: Easy consent revocation process
- **Consent Audit**: Track all consent changes

### **4. Incident Response Plan**

#### **Data Breach Response (72-hour protocol)**
1. **Hour 0-2**: Detect and contain breach
2. **Hour 2-8**: Assess scope and impact
3. **Hour 8-24**: Notify internal stakeholders
4. **Hour 24-48**: Prepare regulatory notifications
5. **Hour 48-72**: Submit required breach notifications

#### **Breach Classification**
- **Level 1**: <50 records, no sensitive PHI
- **Level 2**: 50-500 records, limited PHI exposure
- **Level 3**: >500 records or high-sensitivity PHI
- **Level 4**: Systematic breach with widespread exposure

### **5. Regular Compliance Audits**

#### **Monthly Security Reviews**
- Access log analysis
- Failed login attempt review
- Permission audit
- Encryption key rotation

#### **Quarterly Compliance Assessments**
- HIPAA compliance checklist
- Third-party security assessment
- Penetration testing
- Employee training verification

#### **Annual Certifications**
- SOC 2 Type II certification
- HIPAA compliance audit
- Security framework review
- Business continuity testing

### **6. Employee Training and Awareness**

#### **Required Training Modules**
- HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules
- Data handling best practices
- Incident reporting procedures
- Patient rights and consent

#### **Ongoing Education**
- Monthly security updates
- Quarterly compliance workshops
- Annual certification renewal
- Specialized role-based training
